    quote: "It's crucial to understand exactly what I mean when I use the term tool. A tool is much more than an \"attitude adjustment.\" If changing your life were only a matter of adjusting your attitude, you wouldn't need this book. Real change requires you to change your behavior—not just your attitude."

    quote: "Let's say you scream when you get frustrated—you let loose on your spouse, your kids, your employees. Someone helps you realize how unseemly this is, how it's damaging your relationships. You now have a new attitude about screaming. You may feel enlightened and better about yourself… until an employee makes a costly mistake. At which point you start screaming without even thinking. A change in attitude won't stop you from screaming because attitudes can't control behavior; they're not strong enough. To control behavior you need a specific procedure to use at a specific time to combat a specific problem. That's what a tool is."

Not only does it take work, it's work you have to do over and over again—every time you get frustrated. A new attitude means nothing unless followed by a change in behavior. The surest way to change behavior is with a tool."

    quote: "Beyond what I've said so far, there's a more crucial difference between a tool and an attitude. An attitude consists of thoughts happening inside your head—even if you change it, you're working within the limitations you already have. The most profound value of a tool is that it takes you beyond what happens inside your head. It connects you to a world infinitely bigger than you are, a world of limitless forces. It doesn't matter whether you call this the collective unconscious or the spiritual world. I found it simplest to call it the \"higher world,\" and the forces it contains I call \"higher forces.\""

    quote: "Avoiding pain wouldn't be a problem if we did it once or twice a year. But for most of us, it's a deeply ingrained habit. We barricade ourselves behind an invisible wall and don't venture out because beyond the wall is pain. This safe space is called the \"Comfort Zone.\" In the most extreme cases, people hide behind the actual walls of their home, afraid to venture into the outside world. That's what it means to be agoraphobic. But for most of us, the Comfort Zone isn't a physical place; it's a way of life that avoids anything that might be painful."

We do this with an endless array of addictive activities: Internet surfing, drugs and alcohol, pornography, the aptly named \"comfort food.\" Even manic gambling and shopping are pleasures of a sort. All these behaviors are widespread—we're an entire culture looking for its Comfort Zone."

    quote: "Whatever your Comfort Zone consists of, you pay a huge price for it. Life provides endless possibilities, but along with them comes pain. If you can't tolerate pain, you can't be fully alive. There are many different examples of this. If you're shy and avoid people, then you lose the vitality that comes with a sense of community. If you're creative but can't tolerate criticism, then you avoid selling your ideas to the marketplace. If you're a leader but you can't confront people, no one will follow you. The Comfort Zone is supposed to keep your life safe, but what it really does is keep your life small."

    quote: "Most of us are like the stick figure, stuck inside the Comfort Zone. To take advantage of the endless possibilities that life provides us, we have to venture out. The first thing we meet is pain. Without a way to get through it, we scurry back to safety. This is depicted in the arrow that goes out, comes close to pain, and turns back again. Eventually, we give up on ever escaping the Comfort Zone; our most treasured dreams and aspirations are lost. Nineteenth-century physician, teacher, and author Oliver Wendell Holmes in \"The Voiceless\" wrote: \"Alas for those that never sing, / But die with all their music in them.\" It is a tragedy to die with your song unsung. What's worse is that we are guilty of stilling our own voices—we silence ourselves."

The Comfort Zone makes us feel good in the moment. Who cares what the future penalty will be? But the penalty does come, bringing with it the worst pain of all—the knowledge that you've wasted your life."

Instead of admitting we're avoiding pain, we tell ourselves we're being virtuous; Vinny had convinced himself he was refusing to \"sell out.\" We end up with a distorted worldview that makes avoidance seem right, even brave and idealistic. This is the worst sin of all—lying to ourselves. It makes change impossible."

Living on the surface, jumping from thing to thing, his energy is diffused, like milk spreading across a tabletop. He makes no impact on the world; when his time on earth is over, it's as if he never lived. The creator won't accept that fate. Everything he does is with the intention of making an impact on the world."

But there's another kind of evolution—best called \"spiritual evolution\"—that has to do with the development of the inner self. The inner self can evolve only by choosing to gain access to higher forces."

These two elements are part of one system, designed to transform you into a creator. But there's a third ingredient, and it's one the universe cannot supply. That ingredient is your free will; specifically, your will to use tools. The choice—evolve or stay the same—is yours. The universe is so respectful of human freedom that it refuses to compel you to evolve against your will."

This response illustrates how the modern mind typically misunderstands spiritual forces. It wants to make them predictably controllable. Yes, moving forward is a powerful way to connect to higher forces. But those forces are ultimately a mystery; they work in ways that are often beyond immediate understanding. The universe won't reward you like a trained seal every time you move forward. In fact, the naive belief that it would is simply another version of the Comfort Zone."

I'd had an overwhelming experience of a higher force, so powerful it carried me out of the Maze, beyond my petty hurt feelings and stubborn rage. I felt a powerful wave of love for everything and everyone—it gave me the strength to overcome my injured pride and anger. I had experienced something that was completely different from what we normally call \"love.\" Most of us think of love in its lower form. You feel this type of love only when the other person is pleasing you. You feel it for your child when he smiles at you adoringly; or your partner when she looks particularly attractive. This form of love is weak because it's a reaction to outer circumstances. The trick to getting out of the Maze is to generate a form of love that's independent of your immediate reactions. After all, your reactions put you in the Maze in the first place. That's what I experienced when I was five years old. It was bigger than my personal reactions, bigger than me. That's love in its higher form. We have a name for this kind of love: \"Outflow.\" Outflow is an infinite, spiritual force that gives of itself without restraint. It's like sunlight, shining equally on everything and everyone. The moment you feel this force, you're lifted above your petty hurt feelings. You no longer need a remedy from the offending person because Outflow is its own reward. Unlike fairness, it's a reward that has real value. It lets you go on with your life."

    quote: "In general, higher forces allow you to do things you never thought you could do. In this case, gratefulness allows you to perceive things you never thought you could perceive. In short, gratefulness is a higher organ of perception, through which you can accurately appreciate a fundamental truth: the universe works—mysteriously—and you're the constant beneficiary of its generosity."

What happened?\" \"This guy was fighting above his weight class, but he was holding his own. In the last round, he took a tremendous shot to the chin. He was lying on the canvas like he was dead. I know it sounds crazy, but after a six count he suddenly came back to life. It was like he flipped a switch. The son of a bitch actually got up and finished the fight. He fought to a draw; it was the greatest fight I ever saw.\" \"Okay. Close your eyes and imagine the moment when he flipped that switch. What do you see happening inside him?\" \"Everything was dark. All of a sudden, there's this spark.\" \"You just saw what you're missing.\" \"That's it? That's what's gonna save me? A fucking spark?\" \"That 'fucking spark' is the only thing that can save you.

Or we call on it when we need to restrain harmful impulses such as overeating or drug use. These are situations where the world around you is of no help—in fact, you have to act despite it. You need a force you can generate completely from inside yourself."

Our approach is the opposite: we're telling you the truth about how difficult it's going to be—and we're going to make you strong enough to face the challenge. Doing that means increasing your willpower—which is what the fifth tool does. In a sense it's the most important one—the tool that makes sure you keep using the other tools. It won't matter how effective the other four are if you don't use them."

    quote: "As patients learn to work with higher forces, they encounter yet another mystery. They feel their powers growing when seemingly out of nowhere something bad happens. Often they're indignant, as if their connection to higher forces was supposed to magically immunize them from adversity. This reaction is a kind of spiritual immaturity. A true adult accepts that there's a fundamental difference between the goals we have for ourselves and the goals the universe has for us. In general, human beings want to succeed in the outer world—build a successful business, say, or find a life partner. In contrast, the universe doesn't care about our external success; its goal is to develop our inner strength. We care about what we achieve on the outside; the universe is interested in who we are on the inside."

    quote: "This language of the heart is alluded to in the biblical story of the Tower of Babel. The story depicts an earlier race of people who spoke \"a single language\" and lived a unified existence. The common interpretation of this story is that it depicts the origin of different languages. But there's a deeper meaning in it: Even those who spoke the same language could no longer understand each other; they had lost the shared language of the heart. We, who are alive now, are the end product of this alienation, and our lives are much the worse for it. We've lost the universal language of the heart, and with it, any sense of an all-inclusive human community. We've lost the sense that we're on the same team and that we have a duty to something higher than ourselves."

He was the first psychotherapist I'd met whose focus was on the solution, not the problem. He was absolutely confident that human beings possessed untapped forces that allowed them to solve their own problems. In fact, his view of problems was the opposite of what I'd been taught. He didn't see them as handicapping the patient; he saw them as opportunities to enter this world of untapped potential."
