When you see this, you realize the difficulty of work on oneself. Such as you are you cannot begin to get something new; you will see that first you must scrub the machine clean; it is too covered with rust."

    "quote": "Identification is a necessary element in every negative emotion; you cannot have a negative emotion without identification. So the study of identification and struggle against identification are very powerful weapons in the struggle with negative emotions. Sometimes you cannot struggle with a negative emotion directly, but by trying not to identify you diminish its power, for all the power of negative emotions lies in identification and imagination."

But if you do it several times you will be able to remember some of the steps, and by the same steps you may come there again. This quiet place is not a metaphor—it is a very real thing."

But mostly we deal with unopened boxes. One box—knowledge, another—being, a third—understanding, and so on. We do not even open the boxes."

    "quote": "By dividing yourself, by not saying 'I' to everything. You can really use the word 'I' only in relation to the more conscious part of yourself—desire to work, desire to understand, realization of not understanding, realization of mechanicalness; that you can call 'I'. 'I' starts growing only in connection with study, with work on oneself; otherwise it cannot grow and there is no change."

    "quote": "Do all negative emotions spring from false personality? How could it be otherwise? It is, so to speak, a special organ for negative emotions, for displaying, enjoying and producing them. You remember that there is no real centre for negative emotions. False personality acts as a centre for them."
