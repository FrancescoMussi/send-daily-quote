    quote: "Man lives in the satisfaction of his appetites, in fears, in struggle, in vanity, in distraction and amusements, in stupid sports, in games of skill and chance, in greed of gain, in sensuality, in dull daily work, in cares and anxieties of the day, and more than anything else in obedience and in the enjoyment of obedience, because there is nothing that the average man likes better than to obey; if he ceases to obey one force he immediately begins to obey another. He is infinitely remote from anything that is not connected directly with the interests of the day or with the worries of the day, from anything which is a little above the material level of his life. If we do not shut our eyes to all this, we shall realise that we cannot, at the best, call ourselves anything but civilised barbarians, that is barbarians possessed of a certain degree of culture."

    quote: "The savage killed his enemy with a club. Cultured man has at his disposal every sort of technical appliance, explosives of terrible power, electricity, aeroplanes, submarines, poisonous gases, and so on. All these means and contrivances for destruction and extermination are nothing but evolved forms of the club. Further, an essential part of our culture consists in slavery and in all possible forms of violence in the name of the state, in the name of religion, in the name of ideas, in the name of morals, in the name of everything imaginable. The inner life of modern society, its tastes and interests, are also full of barbarous traits. Passion for shows and amusements, passion for competitions, sport, gambling, great suggestibility, a propensity to submit to all kinds of influences, to panic, to fear, to suspicions. All these are features of barbarism. And they all flourish in our life, making use of all the means and contrivances of technical culture. The root-cause of the evolution of barbarism lies in man himself; in him are innate the principles which promote the growth of barbarism. In order to destroy barbarism it is necessary to destroy these principles. But we can see that never since the beginning of history as we know it, has civilisation been able to destroy these principles of barbarism in man's soul."

    quote: "As you know, in this system of work, amongst many sayings which have a great density of meaning—namely, that take a long time to understand—there is one saying that \"the level of being of a man attracts his life\". This saying applies to humanity in general. It is useless to think that wars and horrors and revolutions, etc., are exceptional. What is at fault is the level of being of people. But nobody is willing to understand this and whenever war takes place, as I said, people take it as exceptional, and even speak about a future free from war, as soon as the existing war is over. We can see the same process at work now. History repeats itself because man remains at the same level of being —namely, he attracts again and again the same circumstances, feels the same things, says the same things, hopes the same things, believes the same things. And yet nothing actually changes. All the articles that were written in the last war are just the same as the articles written in this war, and will be for ever and ever. But what concerns us more is that the same idea applies to ourselves, to each individual person. As long as there is no change in the level of being, the personal history of a man remains the same. Everything repeats itself in his own life: he says the same things, he does the same things, he regrets the same things, he commits the same things. And all this belongs to this immensely deep idea that the level of being attracts his life."

Consider what the cultured humanity of our time spends money on, what commands the highest price, where the biggest crowds are.

Certain myths, certain forms of art, the traditions and religions are influences which seem to come from \"somewhere else,\" touch us sometimes in the midst of our ordinary life and revive this intuition. Indeed, these influences bring us an impression of inner opening, an opportunity to awaken, and if we are attentive to it, we can recognize that something in ourselves responds - a religious feeling or an inner \"spiritual\" sense, which we feel uplifts us. In this way, there can be developed in certain people a special, almost magnetic sensitivity and attraction to everything that can lead in this direction."

    quote: "If we begin to understand what the Work means we take our lives in a different way. I always find this difficult to explain to those who do not yet catch a glimpse of what is meant. Suppose you were to go on a stage where there were hundreds and thousands of actors dressed up in all sorts of costumes, quarrelling and making love and murdering and so on, and you realized to your horror that they were all fast asleep and were completely identified with their parts, which means that they were taking themselves to be what they had been cast to be in the big drama—what would you do? You would probably seize hold of the nearest one and shake him violently and try to make him wake up. You might shout in his ear and say: \" Don't be so silly, don't stick that knife into that person, you are asleep, you forget who you really are.\" And what do you think the result would be? Probably that knife would be pushed into you! Now if we can see that our lives are somewhat similar to parts given to actors and that each of us has a different part best suited to him, our attitude would change. What does \"best suited to him\" mean? It means best suited to him to wake up from. If you take your life on Earth as an end in itself you can never get to the attitude that the Work teaches. The Work takes life as a means to another end. In various myths and fairy stories and esoteric legends there is the idea that the hero is sent out into the world to seek for something, and he is warned not to forget whence he came— this is one thing that he must always remember. Let me quote from an ancient hymn which contains a great deal of teaching. Here the son of kings is sent by his parents down \"into Egypt\", into the world, to bring back a pearl. But after he had been in the world some time he forgot that he was the son of kings, he forgot the pearl and \"lay in a deep sleep \". He was awakened from sleep and remembered himself. \" I remembered that I was a son of kings,\" he said, \"and my free soul longed for its natural state. I remembered the pearl, for which I had been sent to Egypt . . . and I snatched away the pearl and turned to go back to my Father's house.\" In this allegory you will see that the prince remembered his divine origin, he remembered that he was not what he had begun to take himself in life."

To emerge from this narrow shell, to regain union with the universal consciousness, to pass from the darkness of the egocentered illusion into the light of the non-ego, this was the real aim of the Religion Game as defined by the great teachers, Jesus, Gautama, Krishna, Mahavira, Lao-tze and the Platonic Socrates. Among the Moslems this teaching was promulgated by the Sufis, who praised in their poems the delights of reunion with the Friend. The Master Game is played entirely in the inner world, a vast and complex territory about which men know very little. The aim of the game is true awakening, full development of the powers latent in man. The game can be played only by people whose observations of themselves and others have led them to a certain conclusion, namely, that man's ordinary state of consciousness, his so-called waking state, is not the highest level of consciousness of which he is capable. In fact, this state is so far from real awakening that it could appropriately be called a form of somnambulism, a condition of \"waking sleep. Once a person has reached this conclusion, he is no longer able to sleep comfortably. A new appetite develops within him, the hunger for real awakening, for full consciousness. He who arrives at this conclusion is ready to play the Master Game."

That is, in practising Karma-Yoga, one does not seek always to avoid unpleasant things, as people ordinarily do. Life is to be met with non-identifying. When this is possible, life becomes one's teacher; in no other sense can life become a teacher, for life taken as itself is meaningless, but taken as an exercise it becomes a teacher. Nothing can change being so much as this practice—namely, to take the unpleasant things in life as an exercise."

The noise, movement, everything distracted me. Every minute I lost the thread of attention, found it again, and then lost it again. At last I felt a kind of ridiculous irritation with myself and I turned into the street on the left having firmly decided to keep my attention on the fact that I would remember myself at least for some time, at any rate until I reached the following street. I reached the Nadejdinskaya without losing the thread of attention except, perhaps, for short moments. Then I again turned towards the Nevsky realizing that, in quiet streets, it was easier for me not to lose the line of thought and wishing therefore to test myself in more noisy streets. I reached the Nevsky still remembering myself, and was already beginning to experience the strange emotional state of inner peace and confidence which comes after great efforts of this kind. Just round the corner on the Nevsky was a tobacconist's shop where they made my cigarettes. Still remembering myself I thought I would call there and order some cigarettes. Two hours later I woke up in the Tavricheskaya, that is, far away. I was going by izvostchik [carriage] to the printers. The sensation of awakening was extraordinarily vivid. I can almost say that I came to. I remembered everything at once. How I had been walking along the Nadejdinskaya, how I had been remembering myself, how I had thought about cigarettes, and how at this thought I seemed all at once to fall and disappear into a deep sleep. At the same time, while immersed in this sleep, I had continued to perform consistent and expedient actions. I left the tobacconist, called at my Hat in the Liteiny, telephoned to the printers. I wrote two letters. Then again I went out of the house. I walked on the left side of the Nevsky up to the Gostinoy Dvor intending to go to the Offitzerskaya. Then I had changed my mind as it was getting late. I had taken an izvostchik and was driving to the Kavalergardskaya to my printers. And on the way while driving along the Tavricheskaya I began to feel a strange uneasiness, as though I had forgotten something.—And suddenly I remembered that I had forgotten to remember myself. I said that European and Western psychology in general had overlooked a fact of tremendous importance, namely, that we do not remember ourselves; that we live and act and reason in deep sleep, not metaphorically but in absolute reality. And also that, at the same time, we can remember ourselves if we make sufficient efforts, that we can awaken."

And during this period from time to time I saw \"sleeping people.\" This requires a particular explanation. Two or three days after Gurdjieff's departure I was walking along the Troitsky street and suddenly I saw that the man who was walking towards me was asleep. There could be no doubt whatever about this. Although his eyes were open, he was walking along obviously immersed in dreams which ran like clouds across his face. It entered my mind that if I could look at him long enough I should see his dreams, that is, I should understand what he was seeing in his dreams. But he passed on. After him came another also sleeping. A sleeping izvostchik went by with two sleeping passengers. Suddenly I found myself in the position of the prince in the \"Sleeping Princess.\" Everyone around me was asleep. It was an indubitable and distinct sensation. I realized what it meant that many things could be seen with our eyes which we do not usually see. These sensations lasted for several minutes. Then they were repeated very weakly on the following day. But I at once made the discovery that by trying to remember myself I was able to intensify and prolong these sensations for so long as I had energy enough not to be diverted, that is, not to allow things and everything around me to attract my attention. When attention was diverted I ceased to see \"sleeping people\" because I had obviously gone to sleep myself. I told only a few of our people of these experiments and two of them when they tried to remember themselves had similar experiences."

This coming back and going away is a normal movement that I need to accept. The feeling of living, of existing, depends on it. My thoughts never stop. When one has passed, another is here, followed by another. I am attached to all of them. But if for a moment a space appears in the thinking, then there is nothing for me to be attached to.

The question arises: Is it possible to acquire command over these fleeting moments of consciousness, to evoke them more often and to keep them longer, or even make them permanent. The first or the lowest state of consciousness is sleep. . . . Man is surrounded by dreams . . . Purely subjective pictures. The second degree of consciousness comes when man awakes. This second state — the state in which we are now; the state in which we work, talk, imagine ourselves conscious beings and so forth — we ordinarily call 'waking consciousness' or 'clear consciousness', but really it should be called 'waking sleep' or 'relative consciousness' if we want to have more prolonged periods of self-consciousness and not merely glimpses, we must understand that they cannot come by themselves. They need will action. This means that frequency and duration of moments of self-consciousness depend on the command one has over oneself. Acquiring self-consciousness means long and hard work"

    quote: "So, at the same time as self-observing, we try to be aware of ourselves by holding the sensation of 'I am here'—nothing more. And this is the fact that all Western psychology, without the smallest exception, has missed. Although many people came very near to it, they did not recognize the importance of this fact and did not realize that the state of man as he is can be changed—that man can remember himself, if he tries for a long time. It is not a question of a day or a month. It is a very long study, and a study of how to remove obstacles, because we do not remember ourselves, we are not conscious of ourselves, owing to many wrong functions in our machine, and all these functions have to be corrected and put right. When most of these functions are put right, these periods of self-remembering will become longer and longer, and if they become sufficiently long, we shall acquire two new functions. With self-consciousness, which is the third state of consciousness, we acquire a function which is called higher emotional, although it is equally intellectual, because on this level there is no difference between intellectual and emotional such as there is on the ordinary level. And when we come to the state of objective consciousness we acquire another function which is called higher mental. Phenomena of what I call supernormal psychology belong to these two functions."

He can not understand why he never thought of it before. He feels that he has only to do this, and all his doubts, artificialities and difficulties will disappear, and all kinds of things will become possible and easy for him, which before he regarded as completely beyond his reach. His whole life will be transformed. In this feeling he is both right and wrong. He is quite right in the belief that if he could remember himself all would be as different as he imagines. Only he does not at first see the enormous resistance in himself to mastering this new state. He does not realise that to achieve self-remembering as a permanent state, or even to achieve frequently recurring moments of it, he must completely reconstruct his life. For this task will require most of the fine matter that his machine can save or make, all the will and attention he can develop by the most constant exercise. He will have to struggle against and eventually give up all the psychopathic ways of burning up this fine matter, which now form such a familiar and apparently necessary part of his life - rancour, irritation, indignation, self-pity, all kinds of fears, all kinds of dreams, all the ways in which he hypnotizes himself into satisfaction with things as they are. Above all, he must want to remember himself, constantly and permanently, no matter how painful and uncomfortable it may be to do so, nor how unpleasant the things which he thus sees in himself and other people. For the moment he ceases to want to remember himself, he loses - at any rate for some time - the possibility of doing so."

While this noise persists, no deep awareness is possible. So for one who really wishes to practice Creative Psychology, the first rule is very simple: enter the silence as often as possible; remain there for as long as possible. Stop thoughts! In the quiet which follows, like the healing silence after a long political speech, permit the impressions brought by each separate sense to float on the surface of a calm awareness. The eye rests on the objects of sight, not naming them, not desiring, passing no judgments. The shapes of buildings, the texture of trees and grass, of clouds and earth, take on a meaning so new, so fresh and so exciting that they seem on the point of relating their innermost secrets.

Here he will see his impotence, his helplessness and his nothingness.

In feeling this, a man may feel his nothingness. And in feeling his nothingness, a man should see himself as he really is, not for a second, not for a moment, but constantly, never forgetting it"

Consciousness is a force, and force can only be developed by overcoming obstacles. Two things can be developed in man: consciousness and will. Both are forces. If man overcomes unconsciousness, he will possess consciousness; if he overcomes mechanicalness he will possess will."

A man is unable to keep watch on the whole of himself, that is, all his different sides. Only school can do this, school methods, school discipline—a man is much too lazy, he will do a great deal without the proper intensity, or he will do nothing at all while thinking that he is doing something; he will work with intensity on something that does not need intensity and will let those moments pass by when intensity is imperative. Then he spares himself; he is afraid of doing anything unpleasant. He will never attain the necessary intensity by himself. If you have observed yourselves in a proper way you will agree with this. If a man sets himself a task of some sort he very quickly begins to be indulgent with himself. He tries to accomplish his task in the easiest way possible and so on. This is not work. In work only super-efforts are counted, that is, beyond the normal, beyond the necessary; ordinary efforts are not counted.\""

He has to find others with whom he can exchange experience and understanding, share experiments. Then if they can put together what they individually discover, they may create a sufficiently strong field of understanding to attract attention and help. So people must keep their eyes open for their fellows. They may find them in very unexpected places."

In ordinary life, no matter what the conditions may be, the chief aim of Man consists in avoiding all unpleasantnesses, difficulties and discomforts, so far as this is possible. In a life governed by the principles of Karma Yoga, a man does not seek to, avoid unpleasantnesses or discomforts. On the contrary, he welcomes them, for they afford him a chance of overcoming them. From the point of view of Karma Yoga, if life offered no difficulties it would be necessary to create them artificially. And therefore the difficulties which are met with in life are regarded not as something unpleasant which one must try to avoid, but as very useful conditions for the aims of inner work and inner development. When a man realizes this and feels it constantly, life itself becomes his 'teacher.'"

We would have enough energy for everything we want to do if we did not waste it on unnecessary things. For instance, the reason why we are so formatory is that we are too dull, we do not feel enough. We think we feel, but this is an illusion. And the reason why we feel so little is because we have no energy available for the emotional centre. Leaks of energy were already spoken about, but the worst of all is expressing negative emotions. If you can stop the expression of negative emotions, you will save energy and never feel the lack of it. We can only hope to become conscious beings if we use in the right way the energy that is now used in the wrong way. The machine can produce enough energy, but you can waste it on being angry or irritated or something like that, and then very little remains."

We always think our negative emotions are produced by the fault of other people or by the fault of circumstances. We always think that. Our negative emotions are in ourselves and are produced by ourselves. There is absolutely not a single unavoidable reason why somebody else's action or some circumstance should produce a negative emotion in me. It is only my weakness.

To stop worry, people who worry and thereby frown too much or pucker up and corrugate their foreheads, clench their fists, almost cease breathing, etc., should begin here— by relaxing the muscles expressing the emotional state, and freeing the breath. Relaxing in general has behind it, esoterically speaking, the idea of preventing negative states. Negative states are less able to come when a person is in a state of relaxation. That is why it is said so often that it is necessary to practise relaxing every day, by passing the attention over the body and deliberately relaxing all tense muscles."

    quote: "In speaking of efforts in the Work—is it not obvious that the mere quantity of efforts is useless in comparison with the quality of the efforts? Mere lip-service, mere imitation of work, mere pretending to work or trying to attract merit —all such efforts, however great in quantity, lead to nothing, because such efforts are insincere. They are of bad quality, however great their quantity may be. The Work is based on inner sincerity. One effort arising out of inner sincerity and unshakeable valuation of the Work will produce a change of being and shift a man's position in the universe because it is qualitative, different from any quantity of external, insincere or weak efforts."

To be one, whole in the face of life, is all that matters. So long as I remain conscious of this, I feel a life within me and a peace that nothing else can give. I am here, alive, and around me ex­ists the entire universe. The life that is around me is in me. I feel this universal life, the force of the universe. And I feel myself existing as part of the world that surrounds me. Here everything helps, even the cushion on which I sit. I am present, awakened to what I am. And I see that the most important thing is to be. I know it— now— and as I know it, I feel related to everything around me. There is no before, no after, only life itself.

    quote: "An inattentive mind is filled with thoughts. In a passive state it is con­stantly creating images and applying them to what I observe. The im­ages provoke pleasure or pain, which is recorded in my memory, and illusions form around desires for satisfaction. In observing from a fixed vantage point, this mind creates a kind of separation, an opposition, a judge that reacts to everything with a preconception based on what has been learned."

    quote: "We spend most of the day in a vague, unfocused state, in which a stream of mechanical inner talking and phantasy goes on endlessly. This is called being between centres. When we are in attention we are in a centre."

    quote: "So, my first conscious act is to know my mechanicalness, to see myself blindly obeying an automatic force of attraction or repulsion, and to realize my own passivity, my inertia in the face of it. My automatism is a prison. So long as I believe myself free, I will not get out. In order to make the necessary effort, I must understand that I am imprisoned. I have to see myself being a ma­chine, to know myself as a machine, and to be here while function­ing as a machine. My aim is to experience being mechanical and never forget it."

    quote: "A man who does everything because he wants to be just the same as other people is of course a man who is not acting from anything internal. He is acting from the outer side of himself, from the Personality, speaking in general. He does not really think what he is doing or even feel what he is doing, save that he is doing his duty, as he was taught. He is going with the mechanical stream of things, and he has no trace of individual thinking, of individual feeling, in regard to any situations that arise, but always acts mechanically according to the formation of his own Personality. In other words, there is no real man there, no real individual, but a kind of mass-produced man."

    quote: "When a man is identified there is no now for him. If he is asleep in Time, being hurried on from past to future, identified with everything, there is no now in his life. There is not even a present moment. On the contrary, everything is running, everything is changing, everything is turning into something else; and even the moment so looked-forward to, so eagerly anticipated, when it comes is already in the past."

    quote: "Suddenly, I was filled with the influx of an immense power. My body seemed to have turned into light. I could not feel its presence in the usual ways. There was no effort, no pain, no weariness, not even any sense of weight. I felt an intense gratitude towards Gurdjieff and Thomas de Hartmann, but they had quietly gone off, having dismissed the class, and leaving me quite alone. My own state was blissful beyond anything I had ever known. It was quite different from the ecstasy of sexual union, for it was altogether free and detached from the body. It was exultation in the faith that can move mountains. All had gone into the house for tea, but I went in the opposite direction towards the kitchen garden, where I took a spade and began to dig. Digging in the earth is a searching test of our capacity for physical effort. A strong man can dig very fast for a short time or slowly for a long time, but no one can force his body to dig fast for a long time even if he has exceptional training. I felt the need to test the power that had entered me, and I began to dig in the fierce afternoon heat for more than an hour at a rate that I ordinarily could not sustain for two minutes. I felt no fatigue and no sense of effort. My weak, rebellious, suffering body had become strong and obedient. The diarrhoea had ceased and I no longer felt the gnawing abdominal pains that had been with me for days. Moreover, I experienced a clarity of thought that I had only known involuntarily and at rare moments, but which now was at my command. […] The phrase 'in my mind's eye' took on new meaning as I 'saw' the eternal pattern of each thing I looked at, the trees, the plants, the water flowing in the canal and even the spade, and lastly my own body. I recognized the changing relationship between 'myself and 'my pattern'. As my state of consciousness changed, I and my 'pattern' grew closer together or separated and lost touch. Time and eternity were the conditions of our experience, and the Harmonious Development of Man towards which Gurdjieff was leading us was the secret of true freedom. I remember saying aloud: \"Now I see why God hides Himself from us.\" But even now I cannot recall the intuition behind this exclamation. Gurdjieff had said to me, at our first meeting at Kuru Cheshme, that it is not enough to know that another world exists: one must be able to enter it at will. Now I was living in Eternity and yet I had not lost my hold on Time. I was aware that Life itself is infinitely richer and greater than all that our thinking mind can possibly know about it. As the pupils began to return to the garden to begin the evening watering, I left my digging and wandered into the forest. I went past the stone quarry, past the saw-pit, along a path that led up the hill behind Avon. The great trees, the grey rocks, the cloudless sky and the murmur of evening insects all blended with my inner life. There was no distinction of outside and inside: everything was where it was, and so was neither inside nor outside of anything else. I no longer wished to test anything or prove anything, I was satisfied to be just as I was. Turning a bend in the path, where there was a big grey rock, I met Gurdjieff. Our meeting seemed inevitable, although I had never been in that part of the Forest before. Without any preliminaries, he began to talk about the energies that work in man. There is a certain energy that is necessary for work on oneself. No man can make efforts unless he has a supply of this energy. We can call it the Higher Emotional Energy. Everyone, by a natural process, makes a small amount of this energy every day. If rightly used, it enables man to achieve much for his own self-perfecting. But he can only get to a certain point in this way. The real complete transformation of Being, that is indispensable for a man who wishes to fulfil the purpose of his existence, requires a very much greater concentration of Higher Emotional Energy than that which comes to him by nature. \"There are some people in the world, but they are very rare, who are connected to a Great Reservoir or Accumulator of this energy. This Reservoir has no limits. Those who can draw upon it can be a means of helping others. Suppose that a man needs a hundred units of this energy for his own transformation, but he only has ten units and cannot make more for himself. He is helpless. But with the help of someone who can draw upon the Great Accumulator, he can borrow ninety more. Then his work can be effective. He let all this sink in, and then stopped, and looking into my eyes said: \"Those who have this quality belong to a special part of the highest caste of humanity. It may be that one day you will become such, but you will have to wait for many years. What you have received today is a taste of what is possible for you. Until now, you have only known about these things theoretically, but now you have experience. When a man has had experience of Reality, he is responsible for what he does with his life. A lecture of Ouspensky came into my mind. He had spoken about the very narrow limits within which we can control our functions, and added: \"It is easy to verify that we have no control over our emotions. Some people imagine that they can be angry or pleased as they will, but anyone can verify that he cannot be astonished at will.\" As I recalled these words, I said to myself: \"I will be astonished.\" Instantly, I was overwhelmed with amazement, not only at my own state, but at everything that I looked at or thought of. Each tree was so uniquely itself that I felt that I could walk in the forest for ever and never cease from wonderment. Then the thought of 'fear' came to me. At once I was shaking with terror. Unnamed horrors were menacing me on every side. I thought of 'joy', and I felt that my heart would burst from rapture. The word 'love' came to me, and I was pervaded with such fine shades of tenderness and compassion that I saw that I had not the remotest idea of the depth and the range of love. Love was everywhere and in everything. It was infinitely adaptable to every shade of need. After a time, it became too much for me, it seemed that if I plunged any more deeply into the mystery of love, I would cease to exist. I wanted to be free from this power to feel whatever I chose, and at once it left me."

    quote: "Here, now at the present moment in time and space. The rhythm of my associations slows down the sensation of my body becomes whole complete, intense and subtle. I feel the pulsation of my blood in all my body. The rhythm of my breathing becomes light, deep, steady. Stillness and serenity inhabit me. There is now only the vigilance of my thought, the feeling of myself, the sensation of myself, the consciousness of all myself."

We say ' I am doing', ' I am sitting', 'I feel', 'I like', 'I dislike' and so on. This is our chief illusion, for the principal mistake we make about ourselves is that we consider ourselves one; we always speak about ourselves as 'I' and we suppose that we refer to the same thing all the time when in reality we are divided into hundreds and hundreds of different 'I's. We do not know that we have not one 'I', but many different 'I's connected with our feelings and desires, and have no controlling 'I'. These 'I's change all the time; one suppresses another, one replaces another, and all this struggle makes up our inner life."
