Yes, sometimes it can be a very oppressive thing and more difficult to stop than people think. There is only one thing—just to look at it from the point of view of personal profit. Does this critical attitude give you anything or not? You will see that it gives you nothing. We often forget this question of personal profit, yet it is not only legitimate, it is the only criterion. Sometimes we spend enormous efforts, time and emotion on things from which we can get no benefit. Perhaps this will help you not to criticize. It is just the same as criticizing the weather."

If you succeed in forming a permanent attitude, then as soon as self-pity appears, pour the solvent over it and it will dissolve."

But, if you like, we can say that they are transformed into some kind of emotion mixed with very much understanding—an emotion of higher parts of centres. Almost any negative emotion we have now can be transformed into an emotion of higher parts of centres. But this needs understanding, conviction that it is necessary, and decision to do it."

We should not admit an emotional power like that over us. You must stop justifying it in your mind. When one stops this justifying, one very often finds that the cause of all these negative emotions is some wrong idea."

One begins with self-remembering in the morning and finishes with it at night. One can never afford to lay self-remembering aside; one ceases to exist."

It is wonderful when one can see friction as an opportunity. It is such a strange lifesaver we have been cast by higher forces—the lifesaver of transforming suffering."
