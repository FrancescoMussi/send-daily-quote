Does this critical attitude give you anything or not? You will see that it gives you nothing. We often forget this question of personal profit, yet it is not only legitimate, it is the only criterion. Sometimes we spend enormous efforts, time and emotion on things from which we can get no benefit. Perhaps this will help you not to criticize. It is just the same as criticizing the weather."

If you do not see what you have to give up it means that it is not the time to think about it yet. Intellectual thinking about it is quite useless, for when you have to give up something it never comes in the form of a puzzle. Maybe some day you will see some particular kind of negative emotion and will realize that if you want to keep it you cannot work. Or it may be some kind of imagination, or something else of this kind. It always begins in this way."

Catch a moment when your false personality wants to do something or does not want to do something, and stop her. When you find a conflict between you and her, it will depend on you how you will act. If she starts fighting, this creates an emotional storm. If there is no fight, emotions are asleep. All things come through friction, friction between the place where 'I' can grow and false personality. Work on oneself begins from the moment one feels this division between what one trusts in oneself and what one cannot trust. What one can trust is entirely created by work. Before, it was just an empty place, but if one begins to work, something begins to solidify. But, I repeat, one can know it better and trust it more only if one knows one's false personality, otherwise false personality will mix with it and pretend to be real 'I'."

    "quote": "When I experience this more active thinking and sensing together, I discover a new wish, a feeling of urgency to be like this. It is only at the moment this intensity appears—of wishing to see, of wishing to know what is—that I awake to myself and to what I am as a whole. I awake not in order to change but to know the true, the real. What has changed is my attitude. It is more conscious. And I see that if this active wishing is not here, I will fall back into my dream."

    "quote": "In facing life, I am driven by the force of my ordinary “I”, whose very possibility of existing depends on the world that surrounds it. This “I” has a deep fear of being nothing and is afraid of not having security, power, possessions. It is thin-skinned and easily wounded, always eager to be recognized, easily discouraged, rebellious against others, full of self-pity. There is almost constant fear—not a particular but a general fear—of being insecure or incapable, or some other vulnerability. And there is always avidity. I want to obtain, I want to change, I want to become. My usual emotional state is negative, always reacting to people and events from my selfish, ego-centered point of view—what pleases or displeases me, what I like or what I do not like."

    "quote": "Right work on oneself, according to Gurdjieff, begins with the creation of a permanent center of gravity. This distinguishes the stage of being that he called man number four. This is someone who awakes to himself and asks, 'Who am I?' He sees that he does not know he exists, nor how he exists. He sees he is living in a dream and feels a need to know his own reality. He begins to separate things in himself, the real from the imaginary, the conscious from the automatic."

His center of gravity is a question, a question that does not let him sleep. And in order to know himself, he struggles to bring his attention to the point where he can divide it between a Presence that he tries to sustain and a manifestation in which he is lost. This requires a vigilance that can be maintained only if all the centers work with the same intensity."

It wants to be the first, it wants to be recognized, admired and respected, and make its force and power felt. This complex entity has been formed over centuries by the psychological structure of society. Do I know this? Not just in passing, or in having noticed it one day or another ... but do I really see it at the moment in each action, when I work, when I eat, when I speak with another person? Can I be aware of my wish to be 'someone' and my way of always comparing myself to another? If I see it, I can experience the wish to liberate myself from it, and also see why I wish to liberate myself. So long as I have not understood that this is the essence of my search, that here is the first step toward knowledge of myself, I will continue to be fooled and all my efforts, all the ways I try to change, will lead only to disappointment."

It desires, fights, defends itself, compares and judges all the time. It wants to be the first, to be admired and to make its force, its power, felt. This 'I' is a center of possession in which all the experiences inscribed in our memory are accumulated. And it is from this center that I wish 'to do'—to change, to have more, to improve. I want to become this, to acquire that. This 'I' always wants to possess more. With ambition, avidity, it always has to become something better. Why does the 'I' have this exaggerated need to be something, to make sure of it, and to express this at every moment? It has a fear of being nothing."

There can be no purity without vigilance, an extraordinary vigilance where there is no longer higher or lower, no more struggle, no more fear. There is only consciousness, joy. For this, in all circumstances I have to be the witness of myself, to withdraw from the mental functioning that gives birth to reactions, and to quiet all ambition, all avidity. Then I can see myself responding to life while something in me, something immobile, does not respond. With this vigilance comes a new valuing. I am touched by a wish, a will, that is the very essence of the feeling of 'I' in all its purity. It is a will to be what I am, awakening to my true nature—'I am' and 'I Am.'"

    "quote": "Why do we have a compelling need to prove ourselves, to actualize ourselves? A profound impulse is at play: the deep fear of being nothing, the fear of total isolation, of emptiness, of solitude. We have created this solitude with our minds, with self-protecting and egocentric thoughts like “me” and “mine,” my name, my family, my position, my qualities. Deep down, we feel empty and alone, living lives that are narrow and superficial, emotionally starved and intellectually repetitious. Because our petty 'I' is a source of suffering, we wish—consciously or unconsciously—to lose ourselves in individual or collective stimulation or in some form of sensation. Everything in our lives—entertainment, games, books, food, drink, sex—encourages stimulation on different levels. We revel in this and seek to find a state of 'happiness,' to maintain a pleasure in which we can forget the 'I.' All the time our minds are busy in evasion, constantly seeking, in one way or another, to be entirely absorbed in something outside ourselves, to be captivated by some belief, love or work. The evasion has become more important than the truth we cannot face."

Identification is a necessary element in every negative emotion; you cannot have a negative emotion without identification. So the study of identification and struggle against identification are very powerful weapons in the struggle with negative emotions. Sometimes you cannot struggle with a negative emotion directly, but by trying not to identify you diminish its power, for all the power of negative emotions lies in identification and imagination. So when you separate identification and imagination, the negative emotion practically disappears, or at any rate changes."

This energy brings a vibration, a note that did not sound until now. It is subtle, very fine, but nevertheless communicates. I feel it. It is an impression I receive, an impression of a life in me. All my possibilities are here. What follows—whether I will open to the experience of Presence—depends on the way I receive this impression."
